# Support the project

## Help out with documentation

If you read through the user manual, and things don't make sense, feel free to get in touch by [raising an issue on github](https://github.com/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-electron/issues/new/choose) chances are that if it's not clear to you it's not clear to others, and I'd love to lower the barrier of entry as much as possible. Also always looking for people to proofread.

## Give  feedback on your use cases

If you have been using this app I am always super interested in hearing about other people's production and post-production workflow, as well as projects they might have used it for, what has worked best and what hasn't.
