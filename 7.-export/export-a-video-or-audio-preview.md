# Export an video or audio preview

You can export a video or audio preview of your paper edit's programme script.

The preview is most likely going to be lower resolution than your original media. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The idea is that if you are collaborating with an exec or editor you could export a word doc version of it, as well as the audio or video preview and share that with them to make collaboration and feedback easier.  
  
Eg add the word doc to google docs, and the audio or video file to [dropbox to make use of those platform commenting features](https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/share/comment-timestamp).
