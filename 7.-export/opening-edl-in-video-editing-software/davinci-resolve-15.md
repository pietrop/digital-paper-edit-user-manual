1. Got to `File` --&gt;  `Import Timeline` --&gt; `Import AFF, EDL, XML ...`
2. Select your EDL file
3. Add sequence settings if needed 
4. If you have your clip in the `Media Pool` it should automatically reconnect the sequence, if you have no clips in the Media Pool it might complain and note let you import the EDL. Otherwise if the right clip are not in the media pool, you  might  need to reconnect them to the original. See Davinci Resolve user manual for how.
