# Export animated waveform

You can also export audio as video with an animated  waveform, choose a waveform style and color. 

Color can be any valid [css color name](http://w3schools.sinsixx.com/css/css_colornames.asp.htm) or valid [hex value](https://www.color-hex.com/).

Here's some example of the available waveforms styles 

#### Cline

### Adding captions

To add captions to the automated waveform, at the moment, the exported mp4 could be combined with captions, by [exporting plain text option from this app](./#text-file), and using [subtitlesComposer-app](https://autoedit.gitbook.io/subtitles-composer-app/) to create a caption file.

Then you could then either use an editing software of choice to bring the two together, or the experimental [captions burner app](https://pietropassarelli.com/captions_burner/).
