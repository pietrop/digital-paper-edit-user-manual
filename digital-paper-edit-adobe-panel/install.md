# Install

{% hint style="warning" %}
Work in progress. It is still experimental, and at the moment it's recommended to use the [desktop app](../installing/) and it's[ EDL export option ](../opening-edl-in-video-editing-software/)to work with Premiere.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the desktop app and the Premiere Pro Panel share the same database on the user's machine, so you could do the paper-editing on the desktop app, then close it when done, and open premiere and the adobe panel for exporting the programme script into a sequence.
