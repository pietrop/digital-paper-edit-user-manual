# Uninstalling

For uninstalling the app on the mac use [app cleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that the app saves the transcriptions as well as the audio and video previews media on your file system and not inside the app. This means that if you uninstall using [app cleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) you will lose those files.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Unfortunately after version `1.0.16` of autoEdit 3, app cleaner doesn't fully uninstall the app anymore. If you want to delete your local data, you'd need to delete this folder manually  
`~/Library/Application Support/digital-paper-edit`
{% endhint %}
