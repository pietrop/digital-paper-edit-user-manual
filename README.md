{% hint style="info" %}
This app is in active development. It is an [open source project](https://github.com/pietrop/digital-paper-edit-electron). Itâ€™s [first version](https://pietropassarelli.com/autoEdit.html) was a rough and ready working proof  of concept, the second version \([autoEdit2](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2)\) was originally created as part of a [Knight-Mozilla fellowship](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/) by [Pietro Passarelli](http://pietropassarelli.com/) with the [Vox Media product team](https://product.voxmedia.com/2016/11/22/13669486/faster-video-editing). This last version was initially started as one of the [BBC News Labs](https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/digital-paper-edit) open source projects \([Digital Paper Edit](https://github.com/bbc/digital-paper-edit)\). 

The current version has been renamed to[ autoEdit 3](www.autoEdit.io) extending [autoEdit 2](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/autoEdit_2) and digital paper edit[ philosophy, features and functionalities](https://source.opennews.org/articles/video-editing-made-better-introducing-autoedit/) further.
