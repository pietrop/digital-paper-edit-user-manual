# Working with MXF files

You can [download the Pro Video formats 2.0.4 from Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1396?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) to add native capabilities to preview MXF files in finder.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are working with MXF file but not using FCPX, your mac might not be able to preview `.mxf` files from the finder  unless you open them separately using [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).
{% endhint %}

![MXF files won&apos;t preview if the pro codecs are not installed on your mac](../../.gitbook/assets/mxf-no-preview.png)

If you don't have FCPX the catch is that you need either [FCPX](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) \(299$\), [Motion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motion/id434290957?mt=12)\(49.99$\) or [Compressor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/compressor/id424390742?mt=12) \(49.99$\) to be able to install the[ Pro Video Formats](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1396?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US).

{% hint style="info" %}
However this is more of a convenience for your local setup it doesn't effect your ability to use the app with `.mxf` files.
