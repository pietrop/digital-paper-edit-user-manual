# Working with MXF files

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you are working with MXF file but not using FCPX, your mac might not be able to preview them from the finder  unless you re using VLC
{% endhint %}

![MXF files won&apos;t preview if the pro codecs are not installed on your mac](../../.gitbook/assets/mxf-no-preview.png)

You can [download the Pro Video formats 2.0.4 from Apple.](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1396?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)

But the catch is that you need either [FCPX](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) \(299$\), [Motion](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motion/id434290957?mt=12)\(49.99$\) or [Compressor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/compressor/id424390742?mt=12) \(49.99$\) to be able to install the Pro Video Formats.
