## What is a paper-edit?

in this app you can pull selections from various transcriptions, organise them into a story, and when you are done export that as a video sequence. Through an EDL file, edit decision list, that can be opened with your video editing software of choice to continue editing your video.

If you want to know more about what is paper-editing, and why should you bother, check out this other gitbook ["How to tell compelling stories out of video interviews"](https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/how-to-tell-compelling-stories-out-of-video-inter/content/). It is based on a workshop "_How to craft compelling stories out of video interviews?_" that focussed on the underlying evergreen storytelling principles that transcend the medium, introducing paper-editing in it's traditional paper, scissors and tape as a key story crafting technique to gain insight into the process of interviewed based documentary production.
