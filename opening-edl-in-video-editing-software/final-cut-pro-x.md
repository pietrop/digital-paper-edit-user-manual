# Final cut pro X

{% hint style="danger" %}
Last time I checked EDL where not compatible with FCPX
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For now a workaround for Final cut pro X not supporting EDL is that you can open the EDL in [Davinci resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) convert it to XML that will work with final cut X.
